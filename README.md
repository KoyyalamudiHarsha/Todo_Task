Multi-Select Mode: Long-press any item to enter a contextual action mode to select and delete multiple tasks at once.

Empty State: A helpful message is displayed when the task list is empty.

Modern UI: A clean, responsive UI built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Material 3, including a theme that adapts to system light/dark modes.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is built with a modern technology stack and follows the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure a separation of concerns, making the codebase scalable, maintainable, and testable.

Tech Stack
Language: 100% Kotlin

UI: Jetpack Compose for declarative UI development.

Asynchronicity: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for managing background threads and handling streams of data.

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) on top of a layered Clean Architecture.

Dependency Injection: Hilt for managing dependencies.

Persistence: Room for local database storage.

Navigation: Jetpack Navigation for Compose to handle screen transitions.

Styling: Material 3 for UI components and theming.

Architecture
The application is structured into three distinct layers: UI, Domain, and Data.
